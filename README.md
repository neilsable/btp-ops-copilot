## ✨ What is SAP BTP Ops Copilot?

**SAP BTP Ops Copilot** is a **local-first MVP** that converts  
**SAP BTP–style platform logs** into an **executive-ready incident brief**.

Instead of forcing engineers or consultants to manually interpret raw telemetry,  
the Copilot transforms logs into **clear, leadership-friendly outputs**:
- severity
- confidence
- root cause hypothesis
- business impact
- recommended next actions

All in seconds.

---

## 🎯 Why this matters

Operational logs are:
- noisy
- technical
- fragmented across services

Executives, however, need:
> **clarity, confidence, and next steps — not raw logs.**

SAP BTP Ops Copilot bridges that gap by automating the **translation layer** between
platform telemetry and decision-making.

## 🧠 What the Copilot does

### 1️⃣ Log Ingestion
Parses SAP BTP–style logs and extracts operational signals such as:
- errors, warnings, and timeouts
- HTTP 5xx patterns
- error rate signals
- service and region hints

---

### 2️⃣ Incident Analysis
Generates a structured **incident brief**, including:
- **Severity** (Low / Medium / High)
- **Confidence level**
- **Executive one-liner**
- **Root cause hypothesis**
- **Recommended actions**
- **Business impact**
- **SAP BTP-native next steps**

The output is designed to be **copy-paste ready for leadership updates**.
